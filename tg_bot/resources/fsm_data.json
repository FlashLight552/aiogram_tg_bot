(Ooh)\n\nWhen you're out of sight in my mind\n\n'Cause sometimes I look in her eyes, and that's where I find a glimpse of us\nAnd I try to fall for her touch, but I'm thinking of the way it was\nSaid, \"I'm fine\" and said, \"I moved on\"\nI'm only here passing time in her arms\nHoping I'll find a glimpse of us\n\nTell me he savors your glory, does he laugh the way I did?\nIs this a part of your story? One that I had never lived\nMaybe one day, you'll feel lonely\nAnd in his eyes, you'll get a glimpse\nMaybe you'll start slipping slowly and find me again\n\nWhen you're out of sight in my mind\n\n'Cause sometimes I look in her eyes, and that's where I find a glimpse of us\nAnd I try to fall for her touch, but I'm thinking of the way it was\nSaid, \"I'm fine\" and said, \"I moved on\"\nI'm only here passing time in her arms\nHoping I'll find a glimpse of us\n\n'Cause sometimes I look in her eyes, and that's where I find a glimpse of us\nAnd I try to fall for her touch, but I'm thinking of the way it was\nSaid, \"I'm fine\" and said, \"I moved on\"\nI'm only here passing time in her arms\nHoping I'll find a glimpse of us\n"
